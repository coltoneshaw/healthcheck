With it not set some features may not work as expected. [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/web-server-configuration-settings.html#site-url)                                                                          |

| ID-Only Notifications               | proactive | 游리     | Notification contents are set to `full`  | Setting notifications to ID-Only keeps data off Google / Apple servers and in turn your server is more secure.

| ElasticSearch Live Indexing         | health    | -      | Elasticsearch is not enabled             | Live index batch size controls how often Elasticsearch is indexed in real time. On highly active servers this needs to be increased to prevent an Elasticsearch crash.

| Link Previews                       | adoption  | 游리     | Link Previews are not enabled            | Link Previews are a feature that allows for a preview of a link to be displayed in the Mattermost client to improve end user experience.

Contact your Technical Account Manager for assistance. A common cause of this error is due to connectivity issues.  The root cause can originate from various factors. Depending on the origin of the error, we recommend verifying accessibility of the resource. In some cases, ingress/egress rules might be causing problems, or issues may arise from the nginx configuration. |
